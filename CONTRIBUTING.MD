# contribution guidelines

I consider myself pretty lax when it comes to reviewing code, and I will happily merge any pull request given that it meets the following conditions:

## substantial change

It should be a contribution of some value. Some examples are:
- bug fixes
- new features (that don't break compatibility too much)
- performance optimization improvements

## doesn't break things
Unless you're fixing some sort of **critical** bug or **significantly** improving overrall performance of the package, I would request that you don't make any changes that break or replace too many things

## quality and effort
It's gotta be obvious that you've at least put *some* effort into your PR. For example, you shouldn't open a pull request just to fix a small typo in the README, or remove a blank line from the code. 

*Exception: If i find that the typo is significant enough I may just merge it with the `invalid` label*
