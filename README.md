# compare-string

A lightweight, pure JS package to calculate the degree of similarity between strings. Uses a combination of the [Sørensen–Dice coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) and [Jaccard's Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). Can generally return faster, more accurate results than other edit-distance based algorithms, such as [Levenshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).

## installation
`npm i compare-string`

# usage
```js
const _stringCompare = require("compare-string")
```
